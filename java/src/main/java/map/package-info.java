 *  note* map is not child interface of collection map is totally different from collection
 *  if we want to represent group of object as key value pair then we should go for Map interface like roll no.->name(102->shani,102->sandeep)
 *  in Map interface duplicate keys are not allowed, both key and values are object
 *  implementation classes for Map HashMap(LinkedHashMap), WeakHashMap, IdendityHashMap, Hashtable(Properties *note Hashtable is a child of Dictionary,Dictionary is an abstract class)
